# World Weather Analysis

## Overview and Purpose
In this module challenge, we used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary. For my itenrary, I created a route between four cities to serve as a vacation trip through Mexico using driving as the only method of transportation.
